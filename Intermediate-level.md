ðŸ“‰ Corrective Wave Analysis in Elliott Wave Theory ðŸ“‰
Corrective waves are a key aspect of Elliott Wave Theory, which is used to analyze market movements. They typically occur after a motivation (impulsive) wave and represent a pause or reversal in the trend. Corrective waves usually consist of three sub-waves labeled A-B-C, and they generally move against the prevailing trend of the market.
