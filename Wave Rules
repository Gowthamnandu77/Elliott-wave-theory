                Comprehensive Elliott Wave Rules
***********************************************************

-----------------------------------------------------------
               General Rules for All Waves
-----------------------------------------------------------

Wave Degree Hierarchy:
----------------------
- Waves are categorized by relative size or degree, from largest to smallest:
  Grand Supercycle → Supercycle → Cycle → Primary → Intermediate → Minor → Minute → Minuette → Subminuette
  - Degrees help pinpoint a wave's location in the market's progression.

Action and Reaction:
--------------------
- Actionary waves trend in the direction of the wave of one larger degree.
- Reactionary waves (countertrend) move opposite the trend of the wave of one larger degree.

Fluctuation and Progress:
-------------------------
- Progress occurs through a 5-wave structure (motive wave), while setbacks happen in a 3-wave structure (corrective wave).
- The minimal requirement for progress is five waves forward and three waves back.

Wave Functions:
---------------
- Motive waves advance the trend of one larger degree.
- Corrective waves interrupt the trend of one larger degree.

-----------------------------------------------------------
                    Motive Wave Rules
-----------------------------------------------------------

Wave 2 Retracement:
-------------------
- Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100% of Wave 1.

Wave 3 Extension and Progress:
------------------------------
- Wave 3 always travels beyond the end of Wave 1.
- Wave 3 is never the shortest among Waves 1, 3, and 5.
- Wave 3 must subdivide into five waves (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

Wave 4 Overlap:
---------------
- Wave 4 cannot enter the price territory of Wave 1 in cash markets.
- Overlap might occur in futures markets due to leverage but is rare and usually limited to intraday fluctuations.

Wave Count:
-----------
- Motive waves subdivide into five smaller waves, where the actionary subwaves (1, 3, 5) are motive, and the reactionary subwaves (2, 4) are corrective.

-----------------------------------------------------------
                   Impulse Wave Rules
               (a Subset of Motive Waves)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Structure:
----------
- Impulse waves must subdivide into 5-3-5-3-5.

Wave 3 Impulse Rule:
--------------------
- Wave 3 itself must always be an impulse wave.

Guideline of Equality:
-----------------------
- If Wave 3 is the longest, Waves 1 and 5 often tend to be approximately equal in length.

-----------------------------------------------------------
                   Corrective Wave Rules
-----------------------------------------------------------

Structure:
----------
- Corrective waves subdivide into three waves (A, B, C) or combinations of three-wave structures.

Flat Corrections:
-----------------
- Subdivide as 3-3-5.
  - Expanded Flat: Wave B exceeds the origin of Wave A, and Wave C extends beyond Wave A.

Zigzags:
--------
- Subdivide as 5-3-5.
- Zigzags typically indicate sharp corrections.

Triangles:
----------
- Subdivide into five waves labeled A-B-C-D-E, which collectively move sideways.
- Triangles appear in Wave 4, B, or X positions.

Double and Triple Three:
-------------------------
- Combinations of simple corrective patterns separated by an X wave.

-----------------------------------------------------------
        Guidelines (Not Rules but Common Characteristics)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Alternation:
------------
- If Wave 2 is sharp, Wave 4 will be sideways, and vice versa.

Channeling:
-----------
- Impulse waves often fit within parallel trendlines.
  - The upper boundary connects Waves 1 and 3, while the lower boundary connects Waves 2 and 4.

Extension:
----------
- One of the three actionary waves (1, 3, or 5) often extends, typically Wave 3.

Truncation:
-----------
- Wave 5 fails to exceed the end of Wave 3, often occurring after a strong Wave 3.

Fibonacci Relationships:
------------------------
- Waves often exhibit Fibonacci proportions in price and time:
  - Wave 2 retraces 61.8%, 50%, or 38.2% of Wave 1.
  - Wave 4 retraces 38.2% or 23.6% of Wave 3.
  - Wave 5 often equals Wave 1 or relates to Wave 3 by a Fibonacci ratio.
