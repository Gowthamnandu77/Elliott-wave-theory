Wave C, can retrace up to 0.78 to 1.2. very rare cases are it extends up to 1.6

Wave 1 need to break previous swing high to form new swing high, that makes market strcture shift.

Wave 3 swing high can be predicted based on wave 3.3 and 3.4 to calculate wave 3.5. wave 3.4 need to retrace up to 0.3 to 0.6

The end of wave 4 can be calculated as considering the entire wave from wave1 starting point;

Wave 5 can go up to min 0.3 level. In rare cases it extends up to 0.7, then in next corrective wave the entire wave5 can be retraced.





* And we can predict the wave potential based on parallel channeling: 

Draw channeling requires min 3 connecting points on parallel channeling.
