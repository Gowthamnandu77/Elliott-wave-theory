## Introduction 🚀

Elliott Wave Theory is a powerful market analysis method developed by **Ralph Nelson Elliott** in the 1930s. It provides an insightful structure of waves that can be used to predict market movements and identify profitable opportunities.

The theory asserts that markets move in repetitive cycles (waves), driven by collective investor psychology. These cycles unfold in a predictable sequence, which traders can use to their advantage.

## What is Elliott Wave Theory? 📈

Elliott Wave Theory suggests that markets move in a series of **impulsive** and **corrective** waves. These waves form specific patterns that can be used to predict future price movements.

1. **Motive Waves (Impulse Waves)**: These move in the direction of the overall trend and consist of five waves.
2. **Corrective Waves**: These move against the trend and consist of three waves.

### Key Principles:

- **Wave 1, 3, 5**: Impulsive waves that move in the direction of the main trend.
- **Wave 2 and 4**: Corrective waves that retrace parts of the preceding impulsive wave.
  
Together, these waves create fractal-like patterns, which can be applied to different timeframes and market contexts.

## Key Features 🔑

- **Wave Identification Algorithms**: Automatically detect impulse and corrective waves in any price data.
- **Real-Time Wave Analysis**: Apply Elliott Wave Theory to live market data for quick decision-making.
- **Visualizations**: Beautifully visualized wave structures to enhance understanding.
- **Flexible Integration**: Integrate with platforms like **TradingView**, **MetaTrader**, or custom trading algorithms.

## How It Works ⚙️

The repository contains multiple scripts that work together to identify and analyze Elliott Waves in real time. Here’s an overview of the workflow:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collects price data from your preferred market (stocks, forex, crypto).
2. **Wave Identification**: The algorithm scans the data and identifies wave structures, classifying them into impulse and corrective waves.
3. **Trend Prediction**: Based on the identified waves, it predicts the next possible price movement using fractal patterns.
4. **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up custom alerts based on wave triggers to enter or exit trades.

### Algorithms Involved:

- **Wave Calculation**: Detects and classifies waves based on **Fibonacci** and **price retracement** levels.
- **Fractal Analysis**: Identifies repeating patterns within different market timeframes.
- **Price Targeting**: Uses Fibonacci extensions and retracements to set target prices for each wave.

🌟 Motive/ Impulsive Wave:
Motive waves, also referred to as impulse waves, are the main driving forces behind market trends in Elliott Wave Theory. 🚀
These waves are composed of five sub-waves: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, all of which move in the direction of the larger prevailing trend. 📈

🌊 Wave 1: The Spark of the Trend 🚀
Initiates the Trend: Wave 1 marks the start of a new trend, signaling the shift from a consolidation or corrective phase into a strong market move. 🔥

Early Stages: It is often characterized by a slow, cautious rise as only a few market participants (usually "smart money") recognize the potential of the new trend. 🧐

Low Volume: Since the trend is in its early stages, market volume during Wave 1 tends to be relatively low, as the broader market has not yet caught on. 📉

Ignorance of the Broader Market: Many traders may still be skeptical of the trend, not yet realizing the full potential of the move. 🤔

Foundation for Further Waves: The strength and structure of Wave 1 lay the foundation for subsequent waves (Wave 2 and beyond), as more participants join in, believing in the trend’s continuation. 🛠️

🌊 Wave 2: The Panic Phase 😱
Occurs after Wave 1: Wave 2 follows the initial surge of Wave 1, often causing a sharp pullback or correction. 🔄

Creates Panic Among Retail Investors ("Dumb Money"): The market dip triggers fear, and many retail investors panic-sell, thinking the trend is over. 😬

Institutional Investors ("Smart Money") Capitalize: While retail investors are running for the exits, institutional investors see the opportunity to accumulate positions, preparing for the next big move in Wave 3. 💰

Retail Investors Get Trapped: Many retail traders, hopeful for a further price decline, get trapped in the pullback, unaware that the bigger move is about to unfold. 🎯

🌊 Wave 3: The Powerhouse of the Trend 💥
Strongest and Most Powerful Wave: Wave 3 is typically the longest and most impulsive wave in the Elliott Wave structure, representing the stage where the market trend gains serious momentum. 🚀

Massive Participation: As the trend accelerates, a large portion of market participants (both institutional and retail investors) jump in, recognizing the potential of the move and driving prices higher. 📊

High Volume: The volume spikes significantly during Wave 3, reflecting the growing belief and enthusiasm surrounding the market’s direction. 📈

Public Awareness: As prices make dramatic moves, more traders flock to join the trend, and the market begins to gain mainstream attention. This is where the "smart money" capitalizes on the early accumulation made during Wave 1. 🧠💸

Momentum and Enthusiasm: Fueled by optimism (in a bullish trend) or fear (in a bearish trend), Wave 3 often leads to a sharp price move, becoming the core of the larger trend. 💪

Wave 3 Never the Shortest: According to Elliott’s rules, Wave 3 can never be the shortest among Waves 1, 3, and 5, ensuring its dominance and power within the structure. ⚖️

Here’s your Wave 4 description with enhanced visuals and structure to make it more captivating:
---

🌊 Wave 4: The Pause Before the Final Push ⏸️
Corrective Wave: Wave 4 is a corrective wave that moves against the prevailing trend, following the strong momentum of Wave 3. It signifies a period of consolidation or retracement. 🔄

Psychological Pause: This wave often reflects a pause in the market as traders take profits from the previous move, resulting in a temporary pullback or hesitation. 🛑

Lower Volume: Compared to the powerful surge in Wave 3, Wave 4 typically exhibits lower trading volume, as many market participants are on the sidelines, waiting for confirmation of the trend's continuation. 📉

Wave 4 Never Overlaps Wave 1: One of the key rules in Elliott Wave Theory is that Wave 4 cannot overlap the price territory of Wave 1. In other words, the price should not retrace beyond the beginning of Wave 1 in an impulsive wave structure. 🚫

Smart Money Re-enters: While retail traders may feel uncertain during this phase, "smart money" often uses this opportunity to accumulate more positions, preparing for the next strong move in Wave 5. 💼

Psychological Impact: Wave 4 can be emotionally challenging for traders, causing doubt about the trend’s strength, but it’s typically a healthy correction before the final thrust of Wave 5. 🧠

🌊 Wave 5: The Final Push Before the Reversal 🚀
Final Impulsive Wave: Wave 5 is the last wave in the impulse wave sequence, representing the final push in the direction of the main trend. It typically signals the last stage before a significant reversal or correction. 🔚

Euphoria and Overconfidence: During Wave 5, market sentiment is at its peak. Traders and investors feel confident and optimistic, driving prices to new highs in a bullish trend or new lows in a bearish trend. 🎉

Volume Divergence: Despite prices continuing to rise or fall, the volume often starts to decrease, signaling that the momentum is weakening. This can be a clear indication that the trend is nearing its end. 📉

Wider Participation: By the time Wave 5 forms, the trend has gained significant public attention, and a large number of retail investors jump in, contributing to the price move. 📢

Frothy Market Conditions: As the trend approaches its peak, irrational exuberance or fear may push prices further, but the move becomes less sustainable as the trend loses steam. 🏁

Precursor to Reversal: Wave 5 typically marks the end of the current trend, often followed by a corrective wave (Wave A) or the beginning of a larger reversal. This is when a top or bottom is formed, signaling the transition to a new trend. 🔄

🌊 Corrective Wave ABC: The Market’s Retracement 🔄
Corrective Waves (ABC): These are counter-trend movements that occur after an impulsive wave cycle. They typically move against the dominant trend, offering a retracement or correction of the previous impulsive waves. 🔻


---

🌊 Wave A: The First Leg of the Correction ⚖️
Initiates the Correction: Wave A marks the beginning of the corrective phase, typically starting with a sharp move in the opposite direction of the prior impulsive wave. 🔄

Panic and Uncertainty: This wave often creates confusion and uncertainty in the market, as participants begin to doubt the strength of the previous trend. 😟

Volume Decreases: As this wave progresses, trading volume tends to decrease, as it’s a corrective phase, and many traders are waiting to see whether the trend will continue or reverse. 📉

---

🌊 Wave B: The Counter-Trend Rally ⚡
Retracement of Wave A: Wave B is a corrective wave that moves in the direction of the previous trend, retracing a portion of Wave A. 🔁

False Hope for Trend Continuation: This wave often creates a false sense of hope or confidence in the original trend, leading many traders to re-enter the market, expecting the trend to continue. 🙌

Volume Picks Up: The market may see increased volume during Wave B, especially if it retraces a significant portion of Wave A. However, this rally is typically short-lived. 📊

---

🌊 Wave C: The Final Leg of the Correction 🔚
Completion of the Correction: Wave C marks the final leg of the corrective pattern, typically extending further than Wave A. 🔁

Capitulation and Panic: During Wave C, market sentiment often reaches its most extreme, with widespread panic or capitulation. Traders caught in the correction may liquidate their positions, driving the market to new extremes. 😱

Strong Decline or Rally: Depending on the trend's direction, Wave C can be a strong downward or upward move, typically larger than Wave A in magnitude. 📉📈
