## Introduction üöÄ

Elliott Wave Theory is a powerful market analysis method developed by **Ralph Nelson Elliott** in the 1930s. It provides an insightful structure of waves that can be used to predict market movements and identify profitable opportunities.

The theory asserts that markets move in repetitive cycles (waves), driven by collective investor psychology. These cycles unfold in a predictable sequence, which traders can use to their advantage.

## What is Elliott Wave Theory? üìà

Elliott Wave Theory suggests that markets move in a series of **impulsive** and **corrective** waves. These waves form specific patterns that can be used to predict future price movements.

1. **Motive Waves (Impulse Waves)**: These move in the direction of the overall trend and consist of five waves.
2. **Corrective Waves**: These move against the trend and consist of three waves.

### Key Principles:

- **Wave 1, 3, 5**: Impulsive waves that move in the direction of the main trend.
- **Wave 2 and 4**: Corrective waves that retrace parts of the preceding impulsive wave.
  
Together, these waves create fractal-like patterns, which can be applied to different timeframes and market contexts.

## Key Features üîë

- **Wave Identification Algorithms**: Automatically detect impulse and corrective waves in any price data.
- **Real-Time Wave Analysis**: Apply Elliott Wave Theory to live market data for quick decision-making.
- **Visualizations**: Beautifully visualized wave structures to enhance understanding.
- **Flexible Integration**: Integrate with platforms like **TradingView**, **MetaTrader**, or custom trading algorithms.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

The repository contains multiple scripts that work together to identify and analyze Elliott Waves in real time. Here‚Äôs an overview of the workflow:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collects price data from your preferred market (stocks, forex, crypto).
2. **Wave Identification**: The algorithm scans the data and identifies wave structures, classifying them into impulse and corrective waves.
3. **Trend Prediction**: Based on the identified waves, it predicts the next possible price movement using fractal patterns.
4. **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up custom alerts based on wave triggers to enter or exit trades.

### Algorithms Involved:

- **Wave Calculation**: Detects and classifies waves based on **Fibonacci** and **price retracement** levels.
- **Fractal Analysis**: Identifies repeating patterns within different market timeframes.
- **Price Targeting**: Uses Fibonacci extensions and retracements to set target prices for each wave.

Motive waves, also referred to as impulse waves, are the main driving forces behind market trends in Elliott Wave Theory. These waves are composed of five sub-waves: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, all of which move in the direction of the larger prevailing trend.

Wave 1:
Initiates the Trend: Wave 1 marks the start of a new trend, signalling the shift from a consolidation or corrective phase into a strong market move.

Early Stages: It is often characterized by a slow, cautious rise as only a few market participants (usually "smart money") recognize the potential of the new trend.

Low Volume: Since the trend is in its early stages, market volume during Wave 1 tends to be relatively low, as the broader market has not yet caught on.

Ignorance of the Broader Market: Many traders may still be sceptical of the trend, not yet realizing the full potential of the move.

Foundation for Further Waves: The strength and structure of Wave 1 lay the foundation for subsequent waves (Wave 2 and beyond), as more participants join in, believing in the trend‚Äôs continuation.

Wave 2:
Occurs after Wave 1
Creates panic among retail investors ("dumb money")
Institutional investors ("smart money") capitalize on this dip to accumulate positions in preparation for Wave 3
Retail investors get trapped, hoping for further prices

Wave 3:
Strongest and Most Powerful Wave: Wave 3 is typically the longest and most impulsive wave in the Elliott Wave structure. It represents the stage where the market trend gains significant momentum.

Massive Participation: During Wave 3, a large portion of market participants (including both institutional and retail investors) joins the trend, recognizing its potential and driving prices further.

High Volume: The volume increases significantly as the trend accelerates, reflecting widespread belief in the market direction.

Public Awareness: As prices rise or fall dramatically, more traders jump in, and the trend gains mainstream attention. This is where the "smart money" capitalizes on the early accumulation in Wave 1.

Momentum and Enthusiasm: Wave 3 is driven by growing optimism (in a bullish trend) or fear (in a bearish trend), and it often leads to a sharp move in price, which forms the core of the larger trend.

Wave 3 Never the Shortest: According to Elliott‚Äôs rules, Wave 3 can never be the shortest among Waves 1, 3, and 5, ensuring its dominance in the structure.

Wave 4:
Corrective Wave: Wave 4 is a corrective wave that moves against the prevailing trend. After the strong momentum of Wave 3, it represents a period of consolidation or retracement.

Psychological Pause: This wave often reflects a pause or hesitation in the market as traders take profits from the previous bullish (or bearish) move, leading to a temporary pullback.

Lower Volume: Compared to the powerful movement in Wave 3, Wave 4 typically exhibits lower trading volume, as many market participants are waiting for further confirmation of the trend‚Äôs continuation.

Wave 4 Never Overlaps Wave 1: One of the key rules in Elliott Wave Theory is that Wave 4 cannot overlap the price territory of Wave 1, meaning the price should not retrace beyond the beginning of Wave 1 in an impulsive wave structure.

Smart Money Re-enters: While retail traders may feel uncertain during this corrective phase, "smart money" often accumulates more positions, anticipating the next strong move in Wave 5.

Psychological Impact: Wave 4 can be emotionally challenging for traders, as they might doubt the trend‚Äôs strength, but it is generally a healthy correction before the final thrust of Wave 5.

Wave 5:
Final Impulsive Wave: Wave 5 is the last wave in the impulse wave sequence, representing the final push in the direction of the main trend. It is typically the last stage of the trend before a significant reversal or correction.

Euphoria and Overconfidence: During Wave 5, market sentiment is often at its peak. Many traders and investors feel confident and optimistic, driving the price to new highs in a bullish trend or new lows in a bearish trend.

Volume Divergence: Although prices continue to rise or fall, the volume often starts to decrease during Wave 5, signaling that the momentum is weakening. This can be a sign that the trend is nearing its end.

Wider Participation: By the time Wave 5 forms, the trend has gained significant public attention, and a large number of retail investors jump in, following the trend. This influx of new participants can contribute to the price move.

Frothy Market Conditions: As the trend approaches its peak, irrational exuberance or fear may drive the market further, but the price action may become less sustainable as the trend loses steam.

Precursor to Reversal: Wave 5 typically marks the end of the current trend, and it is often followed by a corrective wave (Wave A) or the beginning of a larger reversal. This is when a top or bottom in the market is made, signaling the transition to a new trend.
