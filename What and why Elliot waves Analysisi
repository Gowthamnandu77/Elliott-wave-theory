Introduction 🚀
Elliott Wave Theory is a powerful market analysis method developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s. It provides an insightful structure of waves that can be used to predict market movements and identify profitable opportunities.

The theory asserts that markets move in repetitive cycles (waves), driven by collective investor psychology. These cycles unfold in a predictable sequence, which traders can use to their advantage.

What is Elliott Wave Theory? 📈
Elliott Wave Theory suggests that markets move in a series of impulsive and corrective waves. These waves form specific patterns that can be used to predict future price movements.

Motive Waves (Impulse Waves): These move in the direction of the overall trend and consist of five waves.
Corrective Waves: These move against the trend and consist of three waves.
Key Principles:
Wave 1, 3, 5: Impulsive waves that move in the direction of the main trend.
Wave 2 and 4: Corrective waves that retrace parts of the preceding impulsive wave.
Together, these waves create fractal-like patterns, which can be applied to different timeframes and market contexts.

Key Features 🔑
Wave Identification Algorithms: Automatically detect impulse and corrective waves in any price data.
Real-Time Wave Analysis: Apply Elliott Wave Theory to live market data for quick decision-making.
Visualizations: Beautifully visualized wave structures to enhance understanding.
Flexible Integration: Integrate with platforms like TradingView, MetaTrader, or custom trading algorithms.
How It Works ⚙️
The repository contains multiple scripts that work together to identify and analyze Elliott Waves in real-time. Here’s an overview of the workflow:

Data Ingestion: Collects price data from your preferred market (stocks, forex, crypto).
Wave Identification: The algorithm scans the data and identifies wave structures, classifying them into impulse and corrective waves.
Trend Prediction: Based on the identified waves, it predicts the next possible price movement using fractal patterns.
Alerts and Notifications: Set up custom alerts based on wave triggers to enter or exit trades.
Algorithms Involved:
Wave Calculation: Detects and classifies waves based on Fibonacci and price retracement levels.
Fractal Analysis: Identifies repeating patterns within different market timeframes.
Price Targeting: Uses Fibonacci extensions and retracements to set target prices for each wave.
