üí° Introduction
Elliott Wave Theory is a technical analysis approach used to analyze and predict price movements in financial markets. It is based on the idea that markets move in repetitive cycles, driven by collective investor psychology. The theory proposes that market prices move in waves, which can be categorized into distinct patterns.

üìò What is Elliott Wave Theory?
Elliott Wave Theory was developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s. He discovered that financial markets exhibit recurring patterns of waves, which are influenced by the psychology of investors. These waves can be categorized into two types:

Motive Waves: These waves move in the direction of the trend.
Corrective Waves: These waves move against the trend, correcting the market‚Äôs price movement.
The theory suggests that market movements follow a predictable pattern that can be analyzed to forecast future price behavior.

üîÑ Elliott Wave Structure
The Elliott Wave structure is divided into two main cycles:

Motive Wave Cycle: This is a five-wave pattern that moves in the direction of the market trend.

Waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulse waves (moving in the direction of the trend).
Waves 2 and 4 are corrective waves (moving against the trend).
Corrective Wave Cycle: This is a three-wave pattern that moves against the trend and follows the five-wave cycle.

Waves A and C are impulse waves (moving against the trend).
Wave B is a corrective wave (moving in the direction of the trend).
üñäÔ∏è The 5-Wave Motive Cycle
The five-wave motive cycle consists of:

Wave 1: Initial movement in the direction of the trend.
Wave 2: A correction, typically retracing 50%-61.8% of Wave 1.
Wave 3: The longest and most powerful wave, moving strongly in the direction of the trend.
Wave 4: A shallow correction, often a consolidation phase.
Wave 5: The final wave in the direction of the trend, often driven by speculative behavior.
üîÉ The 3-Wave Corrective Cycle
The corrective cycle consists of:

Wave A: A movement against the trend.
Wave B: A partial retracement of Wave A.
Wave C: A continuation of Wave A, typically extending beyond the endpoint of Wave A.
üìä Wave Patterns and Market Phases
Elliott Wave Theory provides a framework for identifying the different phases of market cycles, including:

Impulse Waves: The strong, trending waves in the direction of the primary trend.
Corrective Waves: The waves that counter the primary trend, providing opportunities for re-entry or exits.
üíº Practical Applications
By understanding the structure of Elliott Waves, traders can identify potential trend reversals, support and resistance levels, and entry and exit points in the market. Elliott Wave analysis is often combined with other technical analysis tools, such as Fibonacci retracement levels, to improve prediction accuracy.

üìà Elliott Wave Trading Strategies
Trend Following: Use the five-wave motive cycle to trade in the direction of the trend.
Countertrend: Utilize the three-wave corrective cycle to trade against the prevailing trend when a reversal is anticipated.
Wave Extensions: Look for extended waves (often the third wave) to identify significant price targets and strong movements.
